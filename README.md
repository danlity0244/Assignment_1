charges transaction fees. The transaction fee is not being disclosed to the

those fees back (and then some) simply by partnering with PayBright. It is then
on PayBright to correctly assess the risk of a given payment defaulting. In the
case of PayBright, it tries to minimize that risk by limiting the sum a
customer can borrow as well as banning them if they fail to make a payment.
